                          Big data is a term used to describe large and complex
                          sets of data that are difficult to manage. It's
                          characterized by its volume, velocity, and variety,
                          and is often referred to as the "three V's":
                          <br />
                          Volume: The large amount of data that's collected
                          <br />
                          Velocity: The speed at which the data is created and
                          collected <br />
                          Variety: The range of data types that are included
                          <br />
                          Big data is so large and complex that traditional data
                          management systems can't store, process, and analyze
                          it. However, organizations can use big data to gain
                          insights that can help them make strategic business
                          decisions. Big data is used in machine learning,
                          predictive modeling, and other advanced analytics
                          applications.
                          <br />
                          The definition of big data is constantly evolving, as
                          new data sources and technologies emerge. For example,
                          a single smartphone user can generate around 40
                          exabytes of data each month, which is a lot for
                          traditional computing systems to handle.

                          IT systems:
                          <br />Horizontal integration: <br />A business
                          strategy where a company acquires a competitor or
                          related business that operates at the same level in
                          the industry. This can help a company expand into new
                          markets, diversify its product offerings, and reduce
                          competition. <br />Vertical integration: <br />A
                          business strategy where a company acquires a business
                          operation within the same production vertical, such as
                          a supplier or distributor. This can help a company
                          reduce costs and increase profits, and make it less
                          dependent on suppliers or distributors.
                          <br />Horizontal integration in a smart factory:
                          <br />Involves networking between machines, equipment,
                          and production units. This ensures that devices and
                          software can collect and share production data with
                          other systems. <br />Vertical integration in a smart
                          factory: <br />Involves networking beyond traditional
                          production hierarchy levels, from the sensor to the
                          business level of the company. <br />Horizontal and
                          vertical integration in IT systems: <br />Industry 4.0
                          increases the volume and velocity of data being
                          collected and analyzed, which can support enhanced
